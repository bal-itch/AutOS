# win10-regtweaks
This repository contains Windows 10 registry tweaks that I often make use of. If you consider using the "win10-myprefs.reg" file, please read the code comments before running it on your system. It provides a few important tweaks I make use of on almost all new Windows 10 installs. To see individual tweaks, look under the "registry-extras" directory.
# Usage
Simply double click the .reg files and click OK to apply them. There is an optional PowerShell script for removing junk UWP apps you can run from an admin PowerShell console.
